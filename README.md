* Get those tools working with current text strings
* Figure out how those tools need pointers formatted
* Get those tools working with full list of pointers and text strings
* Develop a comprehensive set of accessories for those tools
* Locate the font glyphs.
* Write a readme that explains how to use those tools to edit text for a mod, or how to translate the game into another language.
